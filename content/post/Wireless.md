Nikola Tesla's work on wireless transmission of energy was one of his most ambitious and visionary concepts. Here's a more detailed look at Tesla's ideas and experiments related to wireless energy transmission:

## Wardenclyffe Tower:
   - Tesla's most famous project related to wireless energy transmission was the construction of the Wardenclyffe Tower on Long Island, New York, in the early 20th century. This tower, with a height of over 180 feet, was intended to demonstrate Tesla's concept of wireless power transmission.

## Resonance and Earth's Conductivity:
   - Tesla believed that by creating resonance between the tower and the Earth's electrical properties, he could transmit electrical energy wirelessly over vast distances.
   - He argued that the Earth itself could be used as a conductor, allowing electrical energy to be transmitted through the ground and the atmosphere.

## World Wireless System:
   - Tesla envisioned a "World Wireless System" where power and information could be transmitted globally without the need for wires.
   - He proposed using a network of towers similar to Wardenclyffe, strategically placed around the world.

## Financial Challenges:**
   - Tesla faced financial difficulties in funding his ambitious projects. Investors were skeptical of the feasibility of wireless energy transmission, and as a result, funding for Wardenclyffe ran out.

## Legacy and Modern Applications:
   - While Tesla's grand vision for wireless energy transmission was not fully realized in his time, his work laid the conceptual groundwork for modern technologies like radio waves, wireless communication, and wireless power transfer.

## Wireless Power Today:
   - Today, wireless power transfer is used in various applications, including wireless charging for smartphones and electric vehicles. However, these systems are based on different principles than Tesla's original concept and are typically designed for short-range transmission.

Nikola Tesla's ideas on wireless energy transmission were ahead of his time and remain a testament to his innovative thinking. While his specific vision of global wireless energy transmission was not achieved, his work has influenced various fields of technology and continues to inspire inventors and researchers today.
