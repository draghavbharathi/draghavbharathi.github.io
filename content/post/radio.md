## Early Radio Work:
Nikola Tesla conducted pioneering work in the field of wireless telegraphy and communication. He developed various devices and systems for wireless transmission of signals, including radio waves.

## Tesla's "Tesla Coil":
While not a radio transmitter itself, Tesla's Tesla coil was an important component in early radio transmitters and receivers. It generated high-frequency alternating currents that could produce radio waves when connected to an antenna.

## Prioritizing Alternating Current (AC):
Tesla was primarily focused on the development of alternating current (AC) electrical systems and wireless power transmission. He didn't commercialize radio technology as prominently as figures like Guglielmo Marconi, who is often credited with the invention of radio.

## Controversy with Marconi:
Tesla and Marconi were involved in a legal dispute over radio patents in the early 20th century. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually upheld Tesla's priority in some aspects of radio technology.

## Tesla's Vision of Wireless Communication:
Tesla had a broader vision for wireless communication beyond traditional radio. He imagined a worldwide system of wireless transmission of power and information using resonant circuits and the Earth itself as a conductor.

## Modern Influence: 
Tesla's work on radio and wireless communication had a lasting impact on the development of these technologies. While he may not be as widely recognized for radio as Marconi, his contributions to electrical engineering and wireless principles are foundational.
