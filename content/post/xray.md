X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that were not directly discovered by Nikola Tesla, but he did make some pioneering contributions and experiments related to X-rays during his career. Here's an overview of Tesla's involvement with X-rays:

## X-ray Experiments:
Tesla conducted early experiments with X-rays in the late 19th century, not long after Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen's discovery of X-rays in 1895. Tesla was known for his innovative and experimental approach to science and technology, and he was curious about the properties of X-rays.

## Invention of the Vacuum Tube:
Tesla's work on X-rays contributed to the development of the vacuum tube, which is an essential component in X-ray machines. Vacuum tubes were used to generate and control X-rays in early X-ray devices.

## Fluorescent and Phosphorescent Materials:
Tesla experimented with various fluorescent and phosphorescent materials that could emit visible light when exposed to X-rays. These experiments had applications in radioluminescence and fluorescence studies.

## Tesla's "Shadowgraphs":
Tesla created images using X-rays, which he referred to as "shadowgraphs" or "radiographs." These images were early X-ray photographs, although they were not as refined as the X-ray images produced by later technologies.

## Contributions to X-ray Technology:
While Tesla's work with X-rays was not as groundbreaking as Roentgen's discovery, his experiments and innovations with vacuum tubes and materials contributed to the early development and understanding of X-ray technology.

It's important to note that the primary credit for the discovery of X-rays goes to Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his work on X-rays. Tesla's involvement with X-rays was part of his broader exploration of various scientific phenomena, and his contributions to the understanding and development of X-ray technology were among his many achievements in the field of electrical engineering.
